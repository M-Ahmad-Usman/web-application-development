        Programming languages continue to evolve, shaping the future of software development. In 2024, Python remains
        the most popular language due to its simplicity and versatility, widely used in AI, data science, and web
        development. JavaScript holds strong as the go-to language for web development, powering both front-end and
        back-end frameworks like React and Node.js. Java continues to be a dominant force in enterprise applications,
        mobile development (Android), and large-scale systems. C++ is favored for high-performance applications,
        including game development, embedded systems, and finance. Finally, Go (Golang) is gaining traction for its
        efficiency in cloud computing, networking, and microservices, making it a preferred choice for modern backend
        development.

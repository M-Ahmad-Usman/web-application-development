    <p>The domestic cat[1][2] (Felis catus[2] or Felis silvestris catus[4], informally Felis domesticus[6][7]) is a small, usually furry, domesticated, carnovorous mammal. It is often called the housecat when kept as indoor pet, [8] or simply the cat when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are valued by humans for companionship and ability to hunt vermin and household pests. They are primarily nocturnal.[9]</p>
